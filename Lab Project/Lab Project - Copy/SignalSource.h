     * An abstraction of any signal source.
     *
     * This is the base class for all signal sources cooperating with the
     * library, be it an array, a text file or a WAVE binary file. Most of
     * algorithms defined in the library expect a pointer or a reference
     * to SignalSource. As it is an abstract virtual base class, it cannot
     * be instantiated on its own. The library ships with a few derived
     * classes for a quick start, including ArrayData, WaveFile etc.
     *
     * Signal sources support the concept of iteration. Use
     * SignalSource::begin() and SignalSource::end() to obtain iterator objects,
     * which allow per-sample data access. The iterators work well with
     * C++ standard library algorithms, so feel free to use them instead of
     * manually looping and calling SignalSource::sample().
     *
     * To create your own type of signal source, inherit this class and define
     * concrete implementations for the following methods:
     *
     * - getSampleFrequency()
     * - getBitsPerSample()
     * - getSamplesCount()
     * - sample()
