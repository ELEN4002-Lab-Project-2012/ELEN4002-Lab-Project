     * Class defining different window types as static methods.
     *
     * In signal processing, window functions are used to "cut out" a part
     * of the signal. The simplest window is a rectangular one - this happens
     * when you take a part of the signal literally as it is, with no
     * modifications. This is fast, but it makes the later signal analysis less
     * precise in frequency resolution. Several other windows exist, each of
     * which has its own advantages and disadvantages in signal processing.
     *
     * If you're not satisfied with rectangular window, and you don't know which
     * of the others to choose, give Hamming a try.
     *
     * Windows are cached with window type combined with its length
     * as a key. It is an efficient way to reduce calls to math functions.
